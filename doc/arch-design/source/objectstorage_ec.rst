Erasure coding
==============

Erasure coding uses a set of algorithms (similar to RAID 6) to allow the recovery
of missing data using a subset of original data.
In theory, EC techniques uses less storage capacity than standard replication,
but keeping the same durability guarantees.
Erasure coding is transparent from the application perspective.

To use erasure coding, you must have a storage policy with an erasure coding data security configured.

Example of storage policy using erasure coding:

   .. code-block:: text

      [STORAGE_POLICY]
      EC=NONE:EC_ISA_6_3

      [DATA_SECURITY]
      EC_ISA_6_3=ec/k=6,m=3,algo=isa_l_rs_vand,distance=1

This describes a storage policy named ``EC`` configured with a data security called ``EC_ISA_6_3`` that uses
the erasure coding backend ISA-L with the following parameters:

* ``algo``: code of the erasure coding backend.

* ``k``: number of data chunks.

* ``m``: number of parity chunks.

* ``distance``: distance between chunks.
